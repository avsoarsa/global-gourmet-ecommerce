# Backend and Database Implementation Tracking

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created comprehensive SQL schema for all required tables
- [x] Added robust error handling in SQL script to handle various database states
- [x] Successfully executed the master SQL script in Supabase
- [x] Implemented proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies with conditional checks
- [x] Added support for auth.uid() function for authentication integration
- [x] Created tables with proper relationships and constraints
- [x] Added sample data for products, categories, reviews, etc.

## Database Schema
The database schema includes the following tables:
1. product_categories - For storing product category information
2. products - For storing product details
3. product_images - For storing product images
4. product_variants - For storing product variants (different sizes, weights, etc.)
5. product_reviews - For storing product reviews
6. review_images - For storing images attached to reviews
7. user_profiles - For storing user profile information
8. addresses - For storing user addresses
9. orders - For storing order information
10. order_items - For storing items in an order
11. wishlist_items - For storing items in a user's wishlist
12. gift_box_templates - For storing gift box templates
13. gift_boxes - For storing custom gift boxes
14. gift_box_items - For storing items in a gift box
15. subscription_plans - For storing subscription plans
16. subscriptions - For storing user subscriptions
17. subscription_items - For storing items in a subscription
18. carts - For storing user cart information
