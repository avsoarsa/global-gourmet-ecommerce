# Accessibility Audit Report

## Overview

This document outlines the accessibility audit conducted for the Global Gourmet e-commerce platform. The audit evaluates the platform's compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and identifies areas for improvement.

## Audit Scope

The audit covered the following areas:
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast
- Text resizing
- Form accessibility
- Image accessibility
- Dynamic content
- Mobile accessibility

## Key Findings

### Strengths
- Semantic HTML structure is generally well-implemented
- Most interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Form fields have associated labels
- Images have alt text
- Color usage is generally consistent

### Areas for Improvement

#### Keyboard Navigation
- **Issue**: Some interactive elements lack visible focus indicators
- **Impact**: Users navigating with keyboards cannot see which element is currently focused
- **Recommendation**: Implement consistent focus styles for all interactive elements

#### Color Contrast
- **Issue**: Some text elements have insufficient contrast with their backgrounds
- **Impact**: Users with low vision may have difficulty reading content
- **Recommendation**: Ensure all text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)

#### Screen Reader Compatibility
- **Issue**: Some dynamic content changes are not announced to screen reader users
- **Impact**: Screen reader users may miss important updates
- **Recommendation**: Use ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates

#### Form Accessibility
- **Issue**: Error messages are not always associated with their respective form fields
- **Impact**: Screen reader users may not understand which field has an error
- **Recommendation**: Use aria-describedby to associate error messages with form fields

#### Mobile Accessibility
- **Issue**: Some touch targets are too small
- **Impact**: Users with motor impairments may have difficulty tapping elements
- **Recommendation**: Ensure all touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels

## Implementation Plan
